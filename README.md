# Vehicle-Detection-and-Counting-using-YOLO-V3
## overview
This is a vehicle detection and counting project that aims to count every vehicle(motorcycle, bus, car, cycle, truck, train) in the frame using YOLOv3 object detection algorithm.This type of application can be implemented in traffic system, vehicle paekinf system etc.

## YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once - Version 3)
YOLOv3 is a real-time object detection algorithm that recognizes specific objects in images, videos, live streaming.YOLO is a CNN architecture for performing real-time object detection.Version-3 of YOLO was created by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi.The official successor of YOLOv3 is YOLOv4, and the newly released YOLOv7 is been marked as State-of-the-art object detector in 2022.


## Prerequisites
* Linux system(Ubuntu 18.04).
* input video for model.
* Yolov3 pretrained weights.
  create a folder yolo-coco and download the weights in that particular folder.
