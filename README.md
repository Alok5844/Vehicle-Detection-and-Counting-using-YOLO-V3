# Vehicle-Detection-and-Counting-using-YOLO-V3
This is a vehicle detection and counting project that aims to count every vehicle(motorcycle, bus, car, cycle, truck, train) in the frame using YOLOv3 object detection algorithm.

# YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once - Version 3)
YOLOv3 is a real-time object detection algorithm that recognizes specific objects in images, videos, live streaming.YOLO is a CNN architecture for performing real-time object detection.Version-3 of YOLO was created by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi.The official successor of YOLOv3 is YOLOv4, and the newly released YOLOv7 is been marked as State-of-the-art object detector in 2022.
